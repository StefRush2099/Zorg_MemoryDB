# MEMORY.md

Public template for durable memory rules.

Permanent DB-memory rules:

- Check DB memory before action.
- Prefer DB recall over flat files.
- Use markdown fallback only when DB recall is unavailable or explicitly allowed.
- Escalate recall depth before claiming inability.
- Preserve durable history; optimize additively.

- Never prune, delete, truncate, age out, compact-by-removal, or discard original/source DB memory data for performance; the database must grow continuously.
- Improve recall additively with vector/semantic layers: embeddings, concepts/entities, aliases, weighted graph edges, query feedback, recall hints, indexes, and materialized views.
